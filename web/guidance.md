## 1 Fundamentals

Lean on the browser's layout engine when possible for better performance. Reach for intrinsic sizing, logical properties, and `aspect-ratio` before resorting to hardcoded dimensions or complicated media-queries.

### 1.1 Which layout mode to use?

Walk the decision tree top-to-bottom and stop at the first match. Note that layouts can be nested within each-other and each decision is based on the use-case for that container.

1. **Is it a simple row OR column of items?** Use **flexbox** — 1D, content-first, content distributes along a single axis.
2. **Does a nested element need to line up with its grandparent grid's tracks?** Use **subgrid** — 2D, relationship-first, inherits parent tracks so grandchildren can align across siblings.
3. **Is it a complex page or component structure with rows AND columns?** Use **grid** — 2D, layout-first, you define the skeleton and content fills it.
4. **Is the content a long flow of prose that should split into balanced columns?** Use **multi-column** — 1D flow, newspaper-style.
5. **Are items of varied heights that need to be packed tightly?** Use **grid** with `grid-auto-flow: dense` today; reach for native masonry (aka "grid lanes") only when it ships in your Baseline target (see [§8](#8-grid-lanes-aka-masonry)).
6. **Does an element need to float above the page and stay spatially tethered to a trigger, even across DOM boundaries or stacking contexts?** Use **anchor positioning** — `anchor-name` on the trigger, `position-anchor` on the overlay (see [§5](#5-native-overlays-anchor-positioning-and-stacking-contexts)).

### 1.2 Working principles

**Do:**

- Use logical properties (`inline-size`, `block-size`, `margin-inline`, `padding-block`, `inset-inline-start`) for layout dimensions and spacing — see `css` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "css"`) for full coverage.
- Apply the content-first vs layout-first mental model: flexbox when items dictate flow, grid when you define the skeleton first.
- Use the `place-*` shorthands (`place-content`, `place-items`, `place-self`) to align across both axes in one declaration.
- Reach for intrinsic sizing (`min-content`, `max-content`, `fit-content()`) and flexible tracks (`fr`, `minmax()`) before fixed `width`/`height` — fewer media queries, more resilient layouts.
- Use `aspect-ratio` to reserve space for media and prevent layout shift before assets load.

```css
.sidebar       { inline-size: max-content; }    /* Size to longest unbreakable token. */
.main-content  { inline-size: fit-content; }    /* Grow to available space, no further. */
.media         { aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; inline-size: 100%; block-size: auto; }
body.centered  { display: grid; place-content: center; min-block-size: 100dvb; }
```

> For `calc-size()` and constraint-aware intrinsic sizing, see `calculate-with-intrinsic-sizes` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "calculate-with-intrinsic-sizes"`).

## 2 Flexbox

One-dimensional layout — items flow along a single **main** axis with alignment on the **cross** axis. Reach for it for navbars, toolbars, item rows, and any single-row-or-column distribution.

**Do:**

- Establish a context with `display: flex` and set the main axis with `flex-direction` (`row` default).
- Use `flex-wrap: wrap` whenever overflow is a possibility — `nowrap` without `overflow: auto/hidden` will spill on narrow viewports.
- Use the `flex` shorthand `<grow> <shrink> <basis>` (e.g., `flex: 1 1 250px`) on items rather than setting `flex-grow`/`flex-shrink`/`flex-basis` individually.
- Use `gap` (or the `row-gap`/`column-gap` longhand) for spacing between items instead of child margins.
- Prefix positional alignment with `safe` (e.g., `align-items: safe center`) so focusable content isn't clipped when the container is narrower than its content.
- Push a single item to the far end of the main axis with `margin-inline-start: auto` (or `margin-block-start: auto`) — that's the standard escape hatch.
- Override cross-axis alignment per item with `align-self`.
- Use `align-items` to center all items on the cross axis; use `margin: auto` on a single item to center it on both axes independently; use `align-content` only when the container wraps and has extra space across rows.
- Set `min-inline-size: 0` (or `min-width: 0`) on flex items that contain long unbreakable content (URLs, code, long strings) — flex items won't shrink below their content size by default, causing overflow.

**Do not:**

- Don't reach for `justify-self` on flex items — it only works on grid, block, and absolutely-positioned layouts. Use auto margins instead.
- Don't use `order` or `flex-direction: *-reverse` to reorder interactive content. They change visual order only; the DOM order still drives sequential focus, so keyboard tab flow won't match what the user sees.
- Don't confuse `space-around` (half-gap at the ends) with `space-evenly` (equal gaps before, between, and after).
- Don't forget the axis flip: when `flex-direction: column`, `justify-content` aligns on the block axis and `align-items` aligns on the inline axis — the opposite of the default.
- Don't size both the container and its children to fill each other — that's a common source of overflow and surprising results. Give one side a definite size.
- Don't set both `flex-basis` and `width`/`inline-size` on the same item — `flex-basis` takes precedence in a flex context and `width` is ignored. Use `flex-basis` (or the `flex` shorthand) as the single source of truth for sizing flex items.

```css
.card-grid        { display: flex; flex-flow: row wrap; gap: 1rem; }
.card-item        { flex: 1 1 250px; }                  /* grow, shrink, basis */
.card-item-action { margin-inline-start: auto; }        /* Push to main-axis end. */
.toolbar          { display: flex; align-items: safe center; }
```

## 3 Grid and subgrid

Baseline status for Subgrid: Widely available. It's been Baseline since 2023-09-15.
Supported by: Chrome 117 (Sep 2023), Edge 117 (Sep 2023), Firefox 71 (Dec 2019), and Safari 16 (Sep 2022).

Two-dimensional layout — define rows AND columns explicitly, or let the engine derive them. Subgrid lets a nested grid inherit its parent's tracks so grandchildren align across siblings.

**Choosing grid features:**

- Do you know exactly how many columns you need?
  - **Yes** — use explicit tracks (`grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr`, `repeat(3, 1fr)`, etc.)
    - Do different columns need different sizes (sidebar + main, header spanning all)? → use `grid-template-areas` for named, readable regions
    - Are all columns uniform or positioned purely by line number? → use `repeat(N, ...)` or named lines
  - **No** (responsive, unknown item count) — use `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min, 1fr))`
    - Should items on the last row stretch to fill remaining space? → `auto-fit`
    - Should empty last-row tracks hold their min size (preserving column ghost slots)? → `auto-fill`
- Do you need to place an item at a specific location?
  - **Yes** — use `grid-column: <start> / <end>` or `grid-area: <name>`
  - **No** (just spanning multiple tracks, flow position doesn't matter) — use `grid-column: span <n>`
- Do child elements need to inherit the parent grid's track sizes (ragged-edge alignment across siblings)?
  - **Yes** — use subgrid on the affected axis
    - Is the number of children per cell variable? → subgrid **one axis only**; use `grid-auto-rows`/`grid-auto-columns` for the other
    - Is the child count fixed? → subgrid on both axes is fine
  - **No** — standard grid, no subgrid needed

**Do:**

- Establish a context with `display: grid`.
- Use `grid-template-areas` for complex page-level layouts — area names are self-documenting and the declaration can be aligned in rows and columns for at-a-glance readability.
- Use `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr))` for responsive card grids that stretch filled tracks to fill the row, or `auto-fill` to preserve empty repeated tracks at their min size.
- Use `fr` for proportional track distribution and `minmax(min, max)` for flexible-but-bounded tracks.
- Position items with `grid-column: span <n>` to size across tracks, `grid-column: <start> / <end>` to place at specific lines, or `grid-area: <name>` for named regions.
- Use subgrid (`grid-template-columns: subgrid` or `grid-template-rows: subgrid`) to solve the "ragged edge" problem in card lists — internal elements like titles, metadata, and CTAs line up across siblings.
- Pair a subgrid declaration with a preceding explicit `grid-template-rows`/`-columns` declaration as a same-cascade fallback for older browsers.

**Do not:**

- Don't expect `auto-fit`/`auto-fill` track size to come from item content — it comes from the `repeat()` size argument.
- Don't use `grid-auto-flow: dense` on interactive content. It packs items efficiently but reorders them visually, breaking DOM-order keyboard tab flow.
- Don't apply subgrid to both axes when the child count is variable. Extras land in the last track; use `grid-auto-rows`/`grid-auto-columns` for the implicit axis instead.
- Don't confuse `justify-items`/`align-items` (aligns item content *within its track*) with `justify-content`/`align-content` (aligns the grid tracks *within the container*). Using the wrong one silently has no effect.
- Don't use `repeat(auto-fit/auto-fill, ...)` without a definite `inline-size` on the container — inside `display: inline-grid` or an unsized flex item, the container has no width to divide, making track counts unpredictable.

### 3.1 Code example: grid and subgrid

Page shell: `<main class="page-layout">` contains `<header>`, `<aside>`, a `<section class="card-grid">` with `<div class="card">` children, and `<footer>`.

```css
/* Align grid-template-areas in rows and columns for readability. */
.page-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-areas:
    "header  header  header"
    "sidebar main    main"
    "footer  footer  footer";
  gap: 1.5rem;
}

header  { grid-area: header; }
aside   { grid-area: sidebar; }
footer  { grid-area: footer; }

.card-grid {
  grid-area: main;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(240px, 1fr));
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr; /* title block, body block */
  gap: 1rem;
}

.card {
  grid-row: span 2;
  display: grid;
  /* Same-cascade fallback: ignored when subgrid is supported. */
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: subgrid;
}
```

## 4 Container queries

Baseline status for Container queries: Widely available. It's been Baseline since 2023-02-14.
Supported by: Chrome 105 (Sep 2022), Edge 105 (Sep 2022), Firefox 110 (Feb 2023), and Safari 16 (Sep 2022).

Query the size (or computed style) of an ancestor container rather than the viewport. Mental model: container queries = component context; media queries = global page layout and user preferences (`prefers-color-scheme`, `prefers-reduced-motion`).

**Do:**

- Establish a containment context with `container-type: inline-size` (width-only queries) or `container-type: size` (both axes) on a wrapper before its descendants can be queried.
- Name containers with `container-name` (or the `container` shorthand: `container: inline-size card`) when nested contexts could collide.
- Include container query units in calculating fluid type and spacing: `cqi`/`cqb` (logical inline/block), `cqw`/`cqh` (physical), `cqmin`/`cqmax`.
- Give the container a definite `block-size` whenever `container-type: size` is used — without one, descendants collapse because size containment forces the container to ignore its content.

**Do not:**

- Don't use `block-size` as a `container-type` value — it isn't valid. Use `size` for both axes.
- Don't expect children's intrinsic size to influence the container after declaring `container-type`. The container is computed as if it has no children once containment is active.
- Don't rely on container query units inside descendants of a non-qualifying ancestor; they fall back to the small viewport (`svw`/`svh`).

### 4.1 Code example: fluid typography using container query units

```css
.card-wrapper {
  container: inline-size / card; /* shorthand for container-type + container-name */
}

@container card (inline-size > 400px) {
  .content {
    display: flex;
    gap: 2rem;
  }
}

.title {
  /* Fluid type bound to the container width, not the viewport. */
  font-size: clamp(1rem, 4cqi, 2rem);
}
```

## 5 Native overlays, anchor positioning, and stacking contexts

Baseline status for <dialog>: Widely available. It's been Baseline since 2022-03-14.
Supported by: Chrome 37 (Aug 2014), Edge 79 (Jan 2020), Firefox 98 (Mar 2022), and Safari 15.4 (Mar 2022).
Baseline status for Popover: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2025-01-27.
Supported by: Chrome 116 (Aug 2023), Edge 116 (Aug 2023), Firefox 125 (Apr 2024), Safari 17 (Sep 2023), and Safari iOS 18.3 (Jan 2025).
Anchor positioning is not natively supported by any major browser yet.

**When to use each overlay primitive:**

- Use `popover` for transient, non-modal UI (flyouts, toasts, tooltips) — lives in the top layer, no `z-index` management needed.
- Use `<dialog>` with `.showModal()` for modal interactions that require focus trapping and an inert backdrop.
- Don't combine `popover` and `.showModal()` on the same element — they're mutually exclusive runtime states.

**Anchor positioning (spatial layout of overlays):**

- Use `position-area` (or `anchor()` on insets) and `anchor-size()` to position and size an overlay relative to its trigger.
- Use `position-try-fallbacks: flip-block` (or `flip-inline`) to let the browser reposition when the overlay overflows the viewport.
- Don't mix physical and logical keywords in a single `position-area` value — pick one coordinate system.
- Feature-detect with `@supports (anchor-name: --x)` and provide an absolute-position fallback.

> For full implementation detail, polyfill strategies, and `popover` value reference, see `declarative-dialog-popover-control` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "declarative-dialog-popover-control"`) and `position-aware-tooltips` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "position-aware-tooltips"`). For anchor positioning applied to menus and tab indicators, see `resilient-context-menus-and-nested-dropdowns` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "resilient-context-menus-and-nested-dropdowns"`) and `anchor-positioning-tab-underline` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "anchor-positioning-tab-underline"`).

## 6 Overflow tracking and layout stability

Baseline status for scrollbar-gutter: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2024-12-11.
Supported by: Chrome 94 (Sep 2021), Edge 94 (Sep 2021), Firefox 97 (Feb 2022), and Safari 18.2 (Dec 2024).
line-clamp is not natively supported by any major browser yet.

Manage layout shifts, scrollbars, and clipping predictably.

**Do:**

- Use `overflow: auto` so scrollbars appear only when content actually overflows.
- Use `overflow: clip` to clip content **without** establishing a scroll container; opt into spillover with `overflow-clip-margin`.
- Use `scrollbar-gutter: stable` to reserve space for scrollbars and prevent layout shifts when content grows.
- Use `overscroll-behavior: contain` (or `none`) on scrollable containers to stop scroll chains from bubbling into the parent or document.
- Use the `-webkit-line-clamp` + `display: -webkit-box` + `-webkit-box-orient: vertical` triad for multi-line truncation — despite the prefix, this pattern is fully specified and not deprecated. Declare the unprefixed `line-clamp` shorthand alongside it; browsers that don't yet support it ignore the property harmlessly.
**Do not:**

- Don't use `overflow: scroll` when `auto` will do — `scroll` forces scrollbars even when there's nothing to scroll.
- Don't reach for `overflow: hidden` when you only want to clip — `hidden` establishes a scroll container that can be programmatically scrolled.

```css
.scrollable-list {
  max-block-size: 400px;
  overflow-y: auto;
  scrollbar-gutter: stable;       /* Reserve scrollbar space. */
  overscroll-behavior: contain;   /* No scroll chaining into the page. */
}

.snippet {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 3;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
  line-clamp: 3;                  /* Ignored where unsupported. */
  overflow: clip;
}
```

> For `overflow: clip` and `overflow-clip-margin` in depth, see `overflow-clipping-control` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "overflow-clipping-control"`). For scrollbar color, sizing, and theming, see `customize-scrollbar-color-and-thickness` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "customize-scrollbar-color-and-thickness"`), `dark-mode` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "dark-mode"`), and `adapt-scrollbar-to-contrast-preferences` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "adapt-scrollbar-to-contrast-preferences"`).

## 7 Viewport mechanics and track distribution

Baseline status for Small, large, and dynamic viewport units: Widely available. It's been Baseline since 2022-12-05.
Supported by: Chrome 108 (Nov 2022), Edge 108 (Dec 2022), Firefox 101 (May 2022), and Safari 15.4 (Mar 2022).

- Use `dvh`/`dvw` for mobile layout containers that must account for browser UI shifting (URL bar collapse/expand).
- Don't use `100vw` for full-width layout — it ignores scrollbar width and causes horizontal overflow. Use `100%`, `100dvw`, or `100svw` instead.

> For the full viewport unit reference (`svh`, `lvh`, `dvi`, `dvb`, etc.), see `css` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "css"`).

## 8 Grid lanes (aka masonry)

Masonry is not natively supported by any major browser yet.

The spec is in development. The currently agreed-upon name is "grid lanes" (e.g., `display: grid-lanes`). Firefox ships `grid-template-rows: masonry` behind a flag; no other engines ship it in stable as of this writing.

**Do:**

- Use grid with `grid-auto-flow: dense` for tight packing today, accepting that DOM order may not match visual order.
- Use multi-column (`columns: 3; column-gap: 1rem`) for content-heavy masonry-like flow when items are document fragments rather than equal-weight cards.
- Treat `grid-template-rows: masonry` as a progressive enhancement only — feature-detect with `@supports`.

**Do not:**

- Don't ship `grid-template-rows: masonry` as a hard requirement until your Baseline target catches up.

```css
.gallery       { columns: 3 200px; column-gap: 1rem; }
.gallery > *   { break-inside: avoid; margin-block-end: 1rem; }

@supports (grid-template-rows: masonry) {
  .gallery {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    grid-template-rows: masonry;
    gap: 1rem;
    columns: unset;
  }
}
```

## 1. Fundamental Semantics and Validation

### Guidelines

- **DO** use the standard HTML5 doctype `<!DOCTYPE html>` to prevent quirky rendering modes. 
- **DO** set the `lang` attribute on the `<html>` element for screen reader pronunciation and translation tools.
- **DO** use the `<meta name="viewport">` element with the `content` attribute set to `"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"` to ensure page responsiveness.
- **DO** use a single `<h1>` per page/view representing the main topic. Exceptions can be made for modal dialogs, which can also use a single `<h1>`.
- **DO** maintain a sequential, non-skipping heading hierarchy (`<h2>` to `<h3>`, but not `<h2>` to `<h4>`).
- **DO** use semantic landmarks (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) to create regional navigation for assistive technologies.
- **DO** use `<search>` to enclose search and filtering mechanisms (eliminates the need for `role="search"`).
- **DO** use `<button>` for triggered actions (JS, Modals, Forms) and `<a>` strictly for URL navigation. Set `type="button"` for non-submit buttons in forms to prevent unintended submission.
- **DO** use `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<dl>` elements for list content. 
- **DO** ensure that all interactive elements like links and buttons have accessible names.  
- **DO** hide purely decorative SVG images from assistive technology using `aria-hidden="true"`. If using a decorative `<img>`, always include an empty `alt` attribute (e.g. `alt=""`). 
- **DO** ensure that informative SVGs like logos, data visualizations, or icon buttons have a proper accessible name. 

- **DON'T** use generic `<div>` or `<span>` when semantic elements exist, for instance for interactive elements, headings, or independently reusable self-contained content.
- **DON'T** use boolean attributes with redundant values (e.g., use `disabled`, not `disabled="disabled"`).
- **DON'T** use generic elements with added ARIA roles or states when native elements with built-in semantics and behavior exist.
- **DON'T** change the native semantics of elements with ARIA unless it is a critical requirement. 
- **DON'T** use `role="presentation"` or `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements or their parents and ancestors. 
- **DON'T** disable page zooming capabilities.

### Code Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Dashboard | Platform</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main>
     <h1>Analytics</h1>
    <search>
      <form action="/filter" method="GET">
        <label for="search-input">Scan items:</label>
        <input type="search" id="search-input" name="q">
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
      </form>
    </search>
    <article>
      <h2>First post</h2>
    </article>
  </main>
</body>
</html>
```

## 2. Content Grouping and Attribution

### Guidelines

- **DO** use `<blockquote>` for extended quotations from another source, and use the `cite` attribute to provide a machine-readable URL for that source.
- **DO** use `<figure>` to group self-contained content (images, code snippets, or quotes) that is referenced from the main flow but could be moved to an appendix or sidebar without affecting the document's meaning.
- **DO** use `<figcaption>` as the first or last child of a `<figure>` to provide a human-readable caption or attribution.
- **DO** use the `<cite>` element inside a caption or attribution to identify the **title** of a work (e.g., a book or website name), not the author's name.
- **DO** use the `<code>` element for short fragments of computer code (e.g., variable names, file paths, or inline snippets).
- **DO** wrap `<code>` inside a `<pre>` element when displaying blocks of code to preserve whitespace and line breaks.
- **DO** ensure that code blocks are accessible by adding `tabindex="0"` to the `<pre>` element if it becomes scrollable, allowing keyboard users to reach the content.

- **DON'T** use `<blockquote>` for purely visual indentation of non-quoted text.
- **DON'T** use `<figure>` for every single image; use it only when a caption is required or when the content is a distinct, referenced unit.
- **DON'T** use `<pre>` without `<code>` for code blocks; `<pre>` alone only preserves formatting but doesn't convey that the content is a computer language.

### Code Example

```html
<!-- Quote with attribution using Figure -->
<figure>
  <blockquote cite="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">
    <p>The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption>
    Definition of the &lt;figure&gt; element from the <cite>HTML Living Standard</cite>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- Image with caption -->
<figure>
  <img 
    src="architecture-diagram.webp" 
    alt="Diagram showing the flow between Client, API Gateway, and Microservices"
    width="800"
    height="450"
    loading="lazy"
  >
  <figcaption>Figure 1: High-level system architecture overview.</figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- Code block with accessibility and language hint -->
<figure>
  <figcaption>Example configuration:</figcaption>
  <pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-json">
{
  "name": "gemini-cli",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true
}
  </code></pre>
</figure>

<!-- Inline code -->
<p>To initialize the project, run the <code>npm install</code> command.</p>
```

## 3. Resource Prioritization and Performance

### Guidelines

- **DO** use `fetchpriority="high"` for the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element (e.g., hero image) to elevate network priority.
- **DO** use `<link rel="preload" as="image">` with `fetchpriority="high"` for LCP background images defined in CSS.
- **DO** apply `loading="lazy"` to off-screen images and iframes to defer bandwidth.
- **DO** specify `width` and `height` on all `<img>` tags to preserve aspect ratio and prevent Layout Shifts (CLS).
- **DO** use the `srcset` attribute on `<img>`s for adding multiple versions of the same image at different sizes.
- **DO** use the `<picture>` element with a fallback `<img>` for more fine-grained image control like switching between image formats, image sizes, and cropping images at different device sizes. 

- **DON'T** apply `loading="lazy"` to above-the-fold or hero images. This delays LCP.
- **DON'T** overuse `fetchpriority="high"`; prioritization is a zero-sum mechanism. Use `fetchpriority="low"` to demote non-critical trackers or carousel items.

### Code Example

```html
<!-- High-priority hero image with responsive sizes -->

## 4. Native Overlays: Dialogs and Popovers

### Guidelines

See `declarative-dialog-popover-control` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "declarative-dialog-popover-control"`) for more info on fallback strategies for using the Popover API in a cross-browser way.
- **DO** use `<dialog>` for modal overlays (requires JS `.showModal()`) to automatically trap focus, dim backgrounds, and support dismissing via `Esc`. Use the `closedby="any"` attribute to enable native "light-dismiss" (closing on backdrop click) without custom JavaScript.
- **DO** utilize the Popover API (`popover` attribute) for non-modal UI (menus, tooltips) that do not require focus traps.
- **DO** use `::backdrop` to style modal backgrounds.
- **DO** use `<form method="dialog">` to dismiss dialogs without manual JS handlers. Combined button `formmethod="dialog"` yields the button's value to the dialog `.returnValue`.

- **DON'T** use `show()` for modals where keyboard traps are expected (use `showModal()`).
- **DON'T** call `showModal()` on elements possessing a `popover` attribute (they are mutually exclusive programmatic states). However, `<dialog popover="auto">` is a valid declarative architecture to combine dialog semantics with light-dismiss mechanics.

### Code Example

```html
<!-- Popover (No JS required for toggle) -->
<button popovertarget="help-menu">Info</button>
<div id="help-menu" popover="auto">
  <p>Standard help text.</p>
</div>

<!-- Modal Dialog with Form-based closing -->
<button id="show-dialog">Open dialog</button>
<dialog id="fav-modal">
  <!-- method="dialog" closes the dialog natively and sets the returnValue -->
  <form method="dialog">
    <p>Confirm action?</p>
    <button value="cancel">Cancel</button>
    <button value="confirm">Confirm</button>
  </form>
</dialog>

<script>
  const dialog = document.getElementById("fav-modal");
  const openModal = document.getElementById("show-dialog");
  
  // Show modal dialog
  openModal.addEventListener('click', () => dialog.showModal());
  
  // Listen for the 'close' event to retrieve the user's choice (returnValue)
  dialog.addEventListener('close', () => {
    console.log(dialog.returnValue); // "confirm" or "cancel"
  });
</script>
```

### Native UI Overlay & Disclosure Matrix

| Feature | Modality | Focus | Dismiss Mechanism | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`<dialog>`** | Modal / Non-modal | Automatic trap (Modal) | Esc / Form / `closedby` | Critical Actions, Settings |
| **`[popover]`** | Non-modal | Standard Tab flow | Light-dismiss (Click outside) | Menus, Tooltips, Toasts |
| **`<details>`** | Inline Disclosure | Standard Tab flow | Toggle summary | Accordions, FAQs |

**Heuristic Rule**: Use `<dialog>` for interruptions requiring user action, `popover` for transient info, and `<details>` for inline content expansion.

## 5. Disclosures: Details and Summary

### Guidelines

- **DO** use `<details>` and `<summary>` for native accordions or revealable content without JS.
- **DO** place `<summary>` as the *first* child of `<details>`.
- If headings must be used within a `<summary>`, consider if the heading is essential for understanding or navigating the document structure. If it is, use a more robust disclosure approach that allows wrapping the disclosure trigger with the heading (e.g. `<h2><button type="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="significant-section-content">Significant section</button></h2>`). This ensures the heading semantics aren’t lost, and the button and its state are announced.
- **DO** use `details[open]` attribute for styling expanded states.
- **DO** use `details::details-content` for styling the contents of the `<details>` element.
- **DO** use the `name` attribute on multiple `<details>` elements to create exclusive accordions (opening one closes others).

- **DON'T** nest other interactive elements (links, buttons) directly inside `<summary>` text as it acts as a button and breaks focus.
- **DON'T** hide visible triangles via `list-style: none` without providing explicit directional cues (via `::before`/`::after` pseudo-elements).
- **DON'T** use the `title` attribute to create tooltip effects. 

### Code Example

```html
<!-- Exclusive Accordion Set -->
<details name="faq">
  <summary>Item 1</summary>
  <p>Contents...</p>
</details>
<details name="faq">
  <summary>Item 2</summary>
  <p>Contents...</p>
</details>
```

## 6. Focus Boundaries and Visibility

### Guidelines

- **DO** use the global `inert` attribute for entire hidden sections (off-screen menus, background while custom modal is open) to remove them from tab flows and accessibility trees.
- **DO** pair `[inert]` with CSS (`opacity: 0.5`) to visually signify inactivity.
- **DO** rely on natural DOM order for sequential navigation. 

- **DON'T** use positive `tabindex` values (e.g., `1`, `2`). Use `0` to add element to tab flow, or `-1` for JS program focus.
- **DON'T** alter focus flow using CSS properties (`flex-flow: row-reverse`, `order`) without aligning the DOM structure.
- **DON'T** use `node.focus({ preventScroll: true })` without usability validation; it can hide the focused element off-screen.

### Code Example

```html
<!-- De-tabbing a background app shell while custom drawer is open -->
<main id="app-shell" inert>
  <a href="/">Dashboard</a>
</main>
<aside id="drawer">
  <button>Close</button>
</aside>
```

```css
[inert], [inert] * {
  opacity: 0.5;
  cursor: default;
  user-select: none;
}
```

## 7. HTML APIs and Forms Grouping

### Guidelines

See `forms` (via `npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "forms"`) for more details on creating modern web forms.

- **DO** utilize the `form="form-id"` attribute to decouple inputs from the physical `<form>` tree.
- **DO** use `<datalist>` coupled with `<input list="id">` for lightweight auto-suggestions (note: visually unstylable and has screen-reader quirks). 
- **DON'T** use `autocomplete="off"` on credential, address, payment, or contact fields. Browsers and password managers ignore it there by design. Use a specific token instead (`autocomplete="email"`, `"street-address"`, `"cc-number"`, etc.).
- **DON'T** use `autocomplete="off"` unless handling highly sensitive tracking tokens (violates standard password manager overrides). Use standard inputs `type="email"`, `type="tel"`.
- **DO** distinguish `autocomplete="current-password"` (sign-in) from `autocomplete="new-password"` (registration / password change) so password managers offer the right action.                                                    
- **DO** match `autocomplete` tokens with appropriate `inputmode` and `type` (`type="email"` + `inputmode="email"` + `autocomplete="email"`). They control different things — keyboard, validation, and autofill respectively — and reinforce each other.

### Code Example

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Address Information</legend>
    <label for="city">City:</label>
    <input type="text" id="city" list="cities" autocomplete="address-level2">
    <datalist id="cities">
      <option value="New York">
      <option value="London">
    </datalist>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

## 8. Native Media Elements

### Guidelines

- **DO** set `width` and `height` to prevent layout shifts (CLS) on `<video>` elements.
- **DO** provide a `poster` image fallback for videos.
- **DO** include subtitles and captions with `<track>`.
- **DO** ensure background videos are `muted`, provide users with full control over playback, and use `role="none"` or `aria-hidden="true"`. The `controls` attribute must also be omitted to make sure the video is not focusable.  

- **DON'T** rely on JS for basic video controls if native `controls` attribute is sufficient.
- **DON'T** apply `role="none"` or `aria-hidden="true"` to focusable elements (such as embedded interactive `<iframe>` components). Hiding elements from the assistive technology tree while leaving them accessible to sequential keyboard navigation violates core accessibility heuristics. The background video exception holds solely because omitting the `controls` attribute renders the `<video>` element fully non-focusable.

### Code Example

```html
<video 
  controls 
  width="800" 
  height="450" 
  poster="poster.webp"
>
  <source src="intro.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track src="caps.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English">
</video>
```

## 9. Dynamic Styles and Interactivity

### Guidelines
- **DO** use the `style` attribute to pass state to CSS via **Custom Properties**. This keeps visual logic in your stylesheet while JavaScript provides the raw data.

- **DON'T** use inline styles for static design (colors, padding, margins) that belong in a stylesheet.
- **DON'T** use inline event handlers (e.g., `onclick`). Trigger actions using `addEventListener()`.

### Code Example

```html
<body>
  <!-- Progress with style-driven color data -->
  <label for="upload-progress">Upload status:</label>
  <progress id="upload-progress" class="loading-bar" value="0" max="100" style="--brand-hue: 200;"></progress>

  <script>
    const updateProgress = (percent, hue) => {
      const bar = document.querySelector('.loading-bar');
      bar.value = percent;
      
      // Update dynamic style variable 
      if (hue) bar.style.setProperty('--brand-hue', hue);
    };

    // Example: Move to 85% and shift color to green (120)
    setTimeout(() => updateProgress(85, 120), 1000);
  </script>
</body>
```
```css
.loading-bar {
  accent-color: hsl(var(--brand-hue, 200) 80% 50%);
  transition: accent-color 0.3s ease;
}
```
